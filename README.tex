\subsubsection{Racket-CFG}\label{racket-cfg}

Author: David Benoit

\subsubsection{Purpose}\label{purpose}

The goal of this library is to create a simulation of the following in
Racket: 1) Context-Free Grammars 2) Push-Down Automata 3) Earley Parser
for efficient Context-Free Grammar parsing

\subsubsection{Why?}\label{why}

I wrote a library that is
\href{https://github.com/benoid/racket-synthesis}{a music theory API} to
Racket's \href{https://github.com/jbclements/RSound}{Rsound}. As part of
that library, I wrote a simple psuedo-random music generator, however,
all of the valid chord progressions that it uses must be written out by
hand.

This library will ultimately be used with
\href{https://github.com/benoid/racket-synthesis}{racket-synthesis} to
create a wider variety of harmonic progressions for the generator, using
Context-Free Grammars to specify the procedural generation of the
harmonic progressions.

It will also allow the racket-synthesis users the opportunity to create
their own progression generators and checkers.

\subsubsection{Current Status}\label{current-status}

The project is currently unfinished. It is a larger project than I
originally anticiated,and is taking longer than originally expected.

What is done so far: * Structure and organization of PDA data * Pattern
matching for PDA state data * Structure and organization of CFG data *
Some structure and organization of Earley parser data

What needs to be done: * PDA machine accepts * CFG accepts (via Earley
Parser) * PDA \textless{}-\textgreater{} CFG conversion

\subsubsection{Run the PDA tests}\label{run-the-pda-tests}

Running the tests in a racket shell will produce cleaner output than
using the Makefile or simply executing the file from the command line.

\begin{verbatim}
$ cd $PROJECT_DIR && make

OR

$ cd $PROJECT_DIR && racket
> (require "./cfg-pda/pda.rkt")
\end{verbatim}
